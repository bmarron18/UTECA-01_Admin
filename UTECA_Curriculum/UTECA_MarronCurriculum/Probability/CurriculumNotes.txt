=======	The Beginnings	====================================

----------------------
The Big Mental Model
----------------------
*Data-generating mechanisms (generators) are based in reality
	Statistical science models the data-generating mechanisms through probability distributions and 
	stochastic processes.These models and other inferences are ESTIMATES OF REALITY and are functions of 
	the generator outputs (aka information or data values).  
	means that they inherit variability from the underlying stochastic process.

*Data-generating mechanisms (generators) produce information (aka data) over time. What is observable?


*We never know the full probability distribution of the variables we are dealing with.
	Statisticians often pretend that we have gone to the Oracle, and in a mystic trance they have 
	revealed to us the full joint probability distribution of X and Y , or at least the exact values of
	all of their moments. As in many mathematical problems, therefore, we have idealized away everything 
	inconvenient. Even the idea that the variables we see are "randomly generated from a probability 
	distribution" is a usually-untestable assumption. Rather than exact knowledge from the Oracle, we 
	have only a limited number of noisy samples from the reality-based data-generating mechanism 
	(aka sampling distribution).
	
My Comment: Statistics in general  Assumes that a) the phenomenon already exists and b) is observable and c) is
measurable. If the system under study is non-stationary and creates new subsets by i)
differentiation of the whole (morphogenesis) or ii) emergence, what is the value of the sampling?
Likewise, what if the system exhibits path dependence and becomes subject to a bifurcation
point. What then is the value of the sampling data? Law confesses,”... stochastic processes for most real (-world) systems do not have steady-state distributions since characteristics of the system change over time.” (p 493)Law, Averill M. 2006.

	1.1 Statistics, Data Analysis, Regression
		Statistics, then, uses probability to model (statistical) inference from data.
	
	6.1 Stochastic Models, Uncertainty, Sampling Distributions
		We thus model the data-generating mechanism through probability distributions and stochastic processes.
		Since a function of a function is a “functional”, and these quantities are functions of the true probability distribution function, we’ll call these functionals or statistical functionals1 . Functionals
could be single numbers (like the total rat population), or vectors, or even whole curves (like the expected time-course of temperature over the year, or the regression of hawks now on rats earlier). 

Statistical inference becomes estimating those functionals, or testing hypotheses about them. Most writers in theoretical statistics just call them “parameters” in a generalized sense, but I will try to restrict that word to actual parameters specifying statistical models, to minimize confusion.
These estimates and other inferences are functions of the data values, which means that they inherit variability from the underlying stochastic process.
